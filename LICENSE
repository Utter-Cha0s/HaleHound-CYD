================================================================================

HaleHound-CYD is a multi-protocol offensive security toolkit built for the
ESP32-2432S028 "Cheap Yellow Display" (CYD) platform. It ports the full
ESP32-DIV HaleHound v2.5.0 firmware to the CYD's 2.8" touchscreen form
factor, adding external CC1101 SubGHz, NRF24L01+PA+LNA 2.4GHz, and GPS
radios via the CYD's breakout pins.
